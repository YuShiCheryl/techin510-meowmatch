#techin 510 learning project

##Project objective:
MeowMatch is a platform that provides personalized cat food and canned meal recommendations based on each cat’s physical condition—such as age, weight, activity level, and health status. It helps cat owners make informed feeding choices by analyzing nutritional requirements and offering tailored suggestions.
The platform also features a detailed ingredient explorer, allowing users to view and compare nutritional content across various cat food brands. To enhance the personalization experience, MeowMatch enables users to log their cat’s preferences, especially canned food flavors their cat dislikes, ensuring future recommendations avoid those options.

##Target users:
-Cat owners, especially new or health-conscious ones.
-Owners of cats with special dietary needs (e.g., sensitive stomachs, obesity, chronic illnesses).

##User Needs:
-Personalized food recommendations based on the cat’s health, age, weight, and activity level.
-Clear, trustworthy ingredient and nutritional information for each product.
-A way to track and avoid flavors their cat refuses to eat.
-Easy, intuitive browsing and comparison between products.

##key deliverables:
-A cat profile creation and customization feature.
-Smart recommendation system based on physical data and preference logs.
-Ingredient and nutrition database with comparison tools.
-A flavor rejection tracker that filters out disliked options in future suggestions.

##Special constraints (e.g., regulatory compliance):
-Ingredient and nutritional data must comply with AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) standards or local equivalents for pet food labeling.
-Ensure data privacy and security when storing user and pet profiles.
-Accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG 2.1) for inclusive design.
-Consider region-specific food availability and labeling differences if targeting multiple markets.

##Expected outcome
A fully functional prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the MeowMatch platform with accurate food recommendations based on abundant food nutrition information.

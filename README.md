# Custom Media Recommender Website

##  Project Scope

This project builds a personalized recommendation website for movies or music using user-uploaded collection data and ChatGPT's language capabilities. Users can upload a file containing their favorite media titles, ratings, and watch/listen dates. The backend system parses this file, extracts relevant information, and generates tailored recommendations through the ChatGPT API. The recommendations are then displayed in an intuitive front-end interface, accompanied by visual explanations.

**Objectives:**
- Enable personalized content recommendations through simple data upload.
- Leverage GPT's language reasoning to reflect user taste.
- Provide users with understandable and engaging recommendations.

**Boundaries:**
- Focus on single-user interaction.
- Only supports file-based input (CSV, JSON, TXT).
- No authentication, social features, or user accounts in the initial version.

---

## Target Users

- Individuals who keep personal lists of movies/music they've consumed.
- Users who enjoy receiving smart, tailored suggestions from AI.
- Non-technical users seeking simple and intuitive recommendation tools.

## Features

- **File Upload Interface**  
  Upload collection files in CSV, JSON, or TXT formats. Example fields: `Title`, `Rating`, `Date Watched`.

- **Data Parsing & Cleaning**  
  Extracts title, genre, and rating from the input file and processes the data for API use.

- **ChatGPT-Powered Recommendations**  
  A custom prompt is generated to retrieve 5 personalized recommendations with concise reasoning based on the user's past media preferences.

- **Interactive Recommendation Display**  
  Recommendations are shown in a visually clear and interactive layout. Users can click a recommendation to view more details.

- **Visualized API Feedback**  
  Displays insights into why certain recommendations were made. This could include:
  - Genre similarity scores
  - Shared keywords or themes
  - Rating distribution comparisons
  - Tag clouds of common descriptors

- **Expandable Architecture**  
  Ready for future features like feedback loops, login systems, history tracking, and music/movie API integration (e.g., Spotify, OMDb).

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Virtual Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your OMDb API key:
```
OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Development Notes

- Always keep your virtual environment activated while developing
- After installing new packages, update requirements.txt:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
- Don't commit the `.env` file or the `venv` directory to version control

#  MeowMatch – Personalized Cat Food Recommendation Platform

##  Project Scope

**MeowMatch** is a data-driven platform designed to provide personalized cat food and canned meal recommendations. The system evaluates nutritional content, compares ingredients across brands, and tracks each cat’s taste preferences and health needs. By combining these insights, MeowMatch tailors suggestions to fit the unique dietary requirements of cats based on their age, weight, health condition, and activity level.

The project aims to empower cat owners—especially those new to feline care or dealing with dietary challenges—to make informed feeding decisions with ease and confidence.

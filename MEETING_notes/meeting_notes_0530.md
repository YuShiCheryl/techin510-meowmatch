# Client Meeting Notes - 05/30


## Meeting Details

- **Attendees**: 
  - Yu Shi (Developer)
  - Jialu Huang (Client)



## Project Testing for Acceptance

### Features Complete
- **Homepage**: Clean landing page with featured products and navigation
- **Profile Management**: Complete cat profile form with health data, preferences, and image upload
- **Search Functionality**: Ingredient-based search with filtering options
- **Product Comparison**: Side-by-side nutritional analysis and recommendations
- **Intelligent Recommendation System**: Rule-based algorithm that matches cat health needs with appropriate food products
- **Session State Management**: Profile data persists across all pages
- **Production Deployment**: Website successfully deployed and accessible online

### Outstanding Items
- Recommendation algorithm weights may need fine-tuning based on user feedback
- Product database could be expanded with more brands
- Placeholder images needs to be replaced

### Project Goal Assessment
**Original Goal**: Create a personalized cat food recommendation system to help cat owners make informed feeding decisions.

**Result**: **Goal Achieved and Exceeded**
- Successfully implemented intelligent recommendation system with nutritional analysis
- Created comprehensive user profiles with health condition tracking
- Developed working algorithm that considers allergies, health conditions, and nutritional needs
- Deployed functional website ready for real users


## Monitoring & Maintenance Plan

### Web Monitoring
- Set up basic analytics to track user engagement
- Monitor website uptime and performance
- Track recommendation system usage and accuracy

### Maintenance Schedule
- Monthly check-ins for bug reports and user feedback
- Quarterly database updates with new products
- As-needed algorithm adjustments based on user behavior


## Developer Fine-tuning Requests

### Priority 1 (This Week)
- Add loading spinners for search and recommendations
- Make adjustment to streamlit theme and display mode

### Priority 2 (Next Month)
- Expand product database with more dry cat food brands
- Optimize recommendation weights
- Enhanced error handling for user inputs


## Reflection

### What Went Well
- **Algorithm Development**: Successfully created working recommendation system that provides real value
- **Session Management**: Solved complex data persistence challenges across multiple pages
- **Production Deployment**: Smooth transition from development to live website
- **User Experience**: Created intuitive interface that's easy for cat owners to use

### Challenges
- **Streamlit Limitations**: Framework constraints required creative solutions for session state
- **Data Validation**: Complex form inputs needed extensive error handling
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Balancing multiple criteria (health, nutrition, allergies) in recommendations

### Lessons Learned
- **Plan for State Management**: Session state architecture should be designed early in development
- **User Testing**: Regular testing catches usability issues before they become problems
- **Database Quality**: Good product data is essential for meaningful recommendations
- **Deployment Preparation**: Early deployment planning prevents last-minute issues


## Next Steps
- [ ] Yu Shi: Implement mobile improvements by next week
- [ ] Jialu Huang: Conduct user testing with 3-5 cat owners
- [ ] Both: Plan feature roadmap for next development cycle

**Meeting Status**: âœ… **Project Accepted - Ready for Public Use**

- **Session State Management**: Profile data persists across all pages
- **Production Deployment**: Website successfully deployed and accessible online

### Outstanding Items 🔧
- Minor mobile responsiveness adjustments needed
- Loading indicators could be improved
- Recommendation algorithm weights may need fine-tuning based on user feedback
- Product database could be expanded with more brands

### Project Goal Assessment
**Original Goal**: Create a personalized cat food recommendation system to help cat owners make informed feeding decisions.

**Result**: ✅ **Goal Achieved and Exceeded**
- Successfully implemented intelligent recommendation system with nutritional analysis
- Created comprehensive user profiles with health condition tracking
- Developed working algorithm that considers allergies, health conditions, and nutritional needs
- Deployed functional website ready for real users

## Reflection

### What Went Well ✅
- **Algorithm Development**: Successfully created working recommendation system that provides real value
- **Session Management**: Solved complex data persistence challenges across multiple pages
- **Production Deployment**: Smooth transition from development to live website
- **User Experience**: Created intuitive interface that's easy for cat owners to use

### Challenges 🔧
- **Streamlit Limitations**: Framework constraints required creative solutions for session state
- **Data Validation**: Complex form inputs needed extensive error handling
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Balancing multiple criteria (health, nutrition, allergies) in recommendations

### Lessons Learned 📚
- **Plan for State Management**: Session state architecture should be designed early in development
- **User Testing**: Regular testing catches usability issues before they become problems
- **Database Quality**: Good product data is essential for meaningful recommendations
- **Deployment Preparation**: Early deployment planning prevents last-minute issues
